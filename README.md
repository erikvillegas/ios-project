# iOS Coding Project
We'd like you to make a simple Imgur gallery app that displays photos tagged with a certain string, and displays comments users have posted for that photo.

Imgur API: https://apidocs.imgur.com

### Gallery Screen
For each item, the following elements should be displayed:
* PNG/JPG Photo. You can ignore other image types such as GIF or MP4.
* Photo title
* Number of views

Tapping on an item will take you to the Photo Comments Screen

### Comments Screen
For the particular photo tapped, this screen should display the same image (but larger), as well as all comments for that photo. Note that comments are heirarchical. To make the parent/child relationship clear, the child comment should be indented 40 points from the parent.

### Extra Credit
* Create some unit tests to validate logic.
* Provide a mechanism to dynamically enter a tag and refresh the gallery screen.
